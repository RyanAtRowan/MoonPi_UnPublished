/*
 * Launch Settings Configuration
 * ------------------------------
 * This configuration file contains settings to define the environment in which the application is run.
 *
 * Environment Modes:
 * - Development: This mode is strictly for local testing. It uses local URLs and certs for testing purposes.
 * - Production: This mode is for deployment purposes. It must be used when publishing the project or pushing changes to the repository.
 *
 * How to Switch Between Environments:
 * - Change "ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT" to "Production" when publishing the project or pushing it to a production environment.
 * - Change "ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT" to "Development" when testing locally.
 *
 * Note: Always ensure that the environment is set correctly before publishing or running the project locally.
