    This project aims to create a solution for saving the price of each scroll in the MMORPG Maplestory. Prices are volatile and change frequently, and the going rate for any given item may change based on time, availability, or marketing trends. Using this solution, users will be able to find the price of an item, even if the item is unavailable due to popularity or scarcity. This is a portfolio site, so it includes my personal portfolio and will soon include a second project.
